        According to the <a href=" https://www.vegsoc.org/info-hub/definition/" add taget="_blank">Vegetarian Society</a>, a vegetarian is someone who does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or by-products of animal slaughter.<br>

                Vegetarian diets contain various levels of fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, nuts and seeds. The inclusion of dairy and eggs depends on the type of diet you follow.<br>
                
                The most common types of vegetarians include:<br>
                <ul>
                <li><b><i>Lacto-ovo vegetarians:</i></b> Vegetarians who avoid all animal flesh, but do consume dairy and egg products.</li>
                <li><b><i>Lacto vegetarians:</i></b> Vegetarians who avoid animal flesh and eggs, but do consume dairy products.</li>
                <li><b><i>Ovo vegetarians:</i></b> Vegetarians who avoid all animal products except eggs.</li>
                <li><b><i>Vegans:</i></b> Vegetarians who avoid all animal and animal-derived products.</li><br>
                </ul>
                Those who do not eat meat or poultry but do consume fish are considered pescatarians, whereas part-time vegetarians are often referred to as flexitarians.<br>
                
                Although sometimes considered vegetarians, pescatarians and flexitarians do eat animal flesh. Therefore, they do not technically fall under the definition of vegetarianism.</p>

      <p>A vegan diet can be viewed as the strictest form of vegetarianism.<br>

                Veganism is currently defined by the<a href=" https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism" add taget="_blank"> Vegan Society</a> as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty as much as possible.<br>
                
                This includes exploitation for food and any other purpose.<br>
                
                Therefore, a<a href=" https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-honey" add taget="_blank"> honey</a>, carmine, pepsin, shellac, albumin, whey, casein and some forms of vitamin D3.<br>
                
                Vegetarians and vegans often avoid eating animal products for similar reasons. The largest difference is the degree to which they consider animal products acceptable.</br>
                
                For instance, both vegans and vegetarians may exclude meat from their diets for health or environmental reasons.</br>
                
                However, vegans also choose to avoid all animal by-products because they believe this has the largest impact on their health and the environment.</br>
                
                In terms of ethics, vegetarians are opposed to killing animals for food, but consider it acceptable to consume animal by-products such as milk and eggs, as long as the animals are kept in adequate conditions.</br>
                
                On the other hand, vegans believe that animals have a right to be free from human use, be it for food, clothing, science or entertainment.</br>
                
                Thus, they seek to exclude all animal by-products, regardless of the conditions in which animals are bred or housed.</br>
                
                The desire to avoid all forms of animal exploitation is why vegans choose to forgo dairy and eggs products that many vegetarians have no problem consuming.
